# CryptOrchids Scripts

This is a nightly script we run to make the CryptOrchids experience better.

1. Update metadata on OpenSea for all tokens so that OpenSea will show a Dead flower if the plant has died
2. Check the heartbeat on the 25 oldest living CryptOrchids so that the Graph Protocol index can pick up on Killed events, keeping its cache up to date
